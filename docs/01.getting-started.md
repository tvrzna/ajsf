# 01. Getting started

## Installation
Installation is simple as you can expect, just extract and place `ajsf.js` file inside your web project, as well as jQuery-like library (e.g. [nunjs](https://github.com/tvrzna/nunjs)).
After that, import script files into your `index.html`. Keep on mind, that jQuery-like library needs to be imported before `ajsf(.min).js`.

```html
<html>
	<head>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="js/nunjs.min.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="js/ajsf.min.js"></script>
	</head>
</html>
```

## First application
Each `ajsf` application defines single context, that could contain custom JavaScript code and custom directives or filters. But first things first, let's define our first application.


```javascript
var app = ajsf('app', function(context) {
	context.value = 'My value';

	return context;
});
```
This is context of our `app.js`. Be sure, that `context` is return parameter of definition function. Defined file could be imported into `index.html` and application should be initialized by adding attribute `ajsf` into `html` tag with value of application name. In our case it is simply `app`.

```html
<html ajsf="app">
	<head>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="js/nunjs.min.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="js/ajsf.min.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="js/app.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<input type="text" ajsf-bind="value" /><br />
		<span ajsf-bind="value"></span>
	</body>
</html>
```
As you can see, context.value is already used in this example as value of text input. Its value is also binded to span. If you'll try to change text input, the change will be visible in span as well.
