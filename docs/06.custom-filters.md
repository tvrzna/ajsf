# 06. Custom Filters

Filters are always useful for custom post-processing of our values. However with custom definition there is much more, that could be achieved.

## How to create filter
Instance of our application provides function called `filter`, that expects name and definition function of directive. The definition function accepts parameters `context`, `value` and `param`.

- `context` is reference to context of space, where is filter presented.
- `value` is the value, that will be post-processed.
- `param` is custom parameter of filter to be useful in post-processing.

## Example
Our `index.html` with our two filters. As you can see, the first one uses parameter. The second uses static value and no parameter, however it comulates filters.
```html
<html ajsf="app">
	<head>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="js/nunjs.min.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="js/ajsf.min.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="js/app.js"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div ajsf-bind="user.balance | suffix ' EUR'"></div>
		<div ajsf-bind="'home.salutation' | translate | suffix ' ' | suffix user.name"></div>
	</body>
</html>
```

As usual, we have to prepare our application in `app.js` with user object and messages, that will work as our translation data.
```javascript
var app = ajsf('app', function(context) {
	context.user = {
		'name': 'Hero of our heart',
		'balance': 123.45
	}

	context.messages = {
		'home.salutation': 'Hello'
	}

	return context;
});
```

As first we should prepare `suffix` filter. On the first try you can see, that there is no need to make lookup in context, if param starts with `'`, it behaves as constant, otherwise it tries to lookup itself.
```javascript
app.filter('suffix', function(context, value, param) {
	return value + param;
});
```

As second we'll create our `translate` filter, that will provides us simple translations.
```javascript
app.filter('translate', function(context, value) {
	return context.messages[value];
});
```
